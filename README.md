# Human Activity Recognition using Machine Learning & Deep Learning

This project aims to classify human activities based on sensor data collected from wearable devices. The solution integrates feature selection using the Wolf Optimization Algorithm, a Random Forest classifier, and a deep neural network for robust performance. A user-friendly Gradio interface is included for real-time predictions.
